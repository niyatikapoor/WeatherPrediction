In this project, we learn how to predict the local weather of a place with machine learning algorithm.  
We start by downloading the data, then we prepare it for machine learning and try a ridge regression model.  
To implement it, we have used python, jupyter notebook, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Weather-predictor.ipynb file is executed line by line on VSCode and the database being used is taken from local_weather.csv file.

The source of our dataset was https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/ which gives the local weather of any place on earth.
